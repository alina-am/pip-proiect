Project Independent Programming - Project

The project was made using Java as the main technology, with JSP, and a MySQL database. The project can be run locally with Apache Tomcat and a WAMP server.

- a driver can add rides, with the number of km and fuel quantity.
- a manager can generate reports for the employees (number of rides and km), cars (quantity of fuel used), and total quantity of fuel used in chosen periods of time.
- an admin is able to see all the data in the database, add, and delete entries.
